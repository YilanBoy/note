# GitHub Markdown Syntax

記錄一些在 Github 上撰寫文件時會用到的特殊 Markdown 語法。

## Alerts

Github 上提供了幾種不同的警告訊息樣式，可以用來強調文件中的重要資訊。

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.
```

這看起來會長這樣：

筆記：

> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

提示：

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

重要：

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

警告：

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

注意：

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.
